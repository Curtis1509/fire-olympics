In 1992 at the Summer Olympic Games, the Olympic cauldron was lit on fire by Paralympic archer Antonio Rebollo shooting a burning arrow over it. At all Olympic Games, prior to lighting the Olympic cauldron is the Olympic torch relay, where runners carry the Olympic flame from Greece, through various places around the world, to the site of an Olympic Games. An Olympic flame’s lineage can always be traced back to originating from the fire ignited outside Hera’s temple in Athens and stays ignited until the closing ceremony.
Our product is an interactive simulation of an arrow being shot through Olympic Rings. The camera perspective is similar to flying a fiery arrow through a sequence of rings from Immortals Fenyx Rising. The arrow will be on fire and involve dynamic particle effects and induce a shadow as it moves through Olympic rings. If the arrow collides with a ring it either impales it, bounces off and drops to the ground, or is knocked off balance. The rings will be partially obscured by environmental effects such as smoke or mist.
